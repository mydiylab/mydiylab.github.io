      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      	I&#8217m a designer and an online stationary shop owner, living in Hong Kong. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development when I was working on the website for my online shop. I realised that I really enjoy coding and coding makes me happy. I understand that having good coding etiquette is essential for a great web developer, and I hope this class will able to strengthen my coding foundation. 
      </p>

      <h3>My Mission</h3>
      	<p>
      		As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a web developer and help other creative entrepreneurs to build their websites.
